    <div2>I am Jake Vinson!</div2>
    <p1>I am a new web devoloper, who resides in the portland metro area. I have learned different languages at 
        pdx code guild and can problem solve different obstacles. I am always looking to enhance my current skills and to learn more.
    </p1>
  
   
    <div3>My Primary languages.</div3>
    <p2>Although I am still learning, I feel that I can navigate through various syntax errors and web design in python and html/css. 
        Before learning code at pdx code guild, I took it upon myself to learn ruby on rails. I do have a small amount of knowledge on 
        this language but do plan to continue learning it
